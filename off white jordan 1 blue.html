            <p>Supplied by a premier sneaker marketplace dealing with unworn, already sold out, in demand rarities. Each product is rigorously inspected by experienced experts guaranteeing authenticity. For his third edition of the monumental Off-White x Air Jordan 1, Virgil Abloh focused on the "UNC" colourway of Michael Jordan's first signature shoe. The high-top pair features the iconic white and Carolina blue leather upper inspired by the University of North Carolina. The colours are complemented by Abloh's deconstructed aesthetic and signature details such as a red zip tie.</p>
