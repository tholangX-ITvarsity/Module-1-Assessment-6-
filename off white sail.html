            <p>Virgil Abloh is back with another deconstructed creation—and this time, he's lending his unique touch to the iconic silhouette of the Air Jordan 4. After sneak peeks in both Paris and Chicago, his latest collaboration has finally arrived, sporting the label's patented bold text graphics and a muted colour make-up.

                Full-grain leather and grid mesh cover the shoe's upper, with clear textile adding a subtle layer of modernity. Bold, all-caps imprints label the laces and Air cushioning, with familiar lettering on the medial side detailing the shoe's Oregon origins. Exposed foam on the collar and a signature Off-White™️ cable tie put the finishing touch on this monochromatic masterpiece.</p>
