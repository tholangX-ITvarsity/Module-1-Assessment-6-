            <p>The third variation of the silhouette  to release in 2017, will be this zebra-inspired finish. Compared to the model’s history of tonal renditions, this particular pair bears a Zebra-like pattern to distinguish itself from the line. Furthermore, it’s suggested that the sneaker features a distinctive aesthetic when exposed under UV lighting to further exemplify its dynamic profile in various lighting conditions.

            Rendered in classic shades of black and white, in addition to accents of red for its signature “SPLY-350” branding on the side panels, the silhouette is topped off with a heel pull tab and crisp white full-length boost sole unit.</p>
